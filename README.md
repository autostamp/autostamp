## About

[WebAssembly Components][component] are universal, portable libraries which can linked to
any other language. This project exists to automate library creation by
taking OpenAPI schema definitions and creating WebAssembly guest components from
them.

The goal of this project is to _automate_ Component-based SDK creation as much
as possible. Hand-crafted components can probably be nicer than what we can
achieve with automation here. But those SDKs currently don't exist, and we believe that it's better to have something that works than nothing at all.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project is not affiliated with any of the projects or entities we publish Wasm Components for. We take publicly available schemas and use open source tools to turn them into publicly available libraries.
